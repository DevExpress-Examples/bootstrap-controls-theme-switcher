<p>This example demonstrates the way of creating a Bootstrap Theme Switcher User Control as inÂ <a href="https://demos.devexpress.com/Bootstrap/GridView/">Devexpress Bootstrap demos</a>Â (all themes are taken from theÂ <a href="https://bootswatch.com/">Bootswatch web site</a>).<br>The selected theme name is stored in cookies.<br><strong>HOW TO APPLY:<br></strong>1. Add all three files in App_CodeÂ directory:Â BootstrapThemeModel.cs,Â BundleConfig.cs,Â ThemeModelBase.cs;<br>2. Add User ControlÂ BootstrapThemeSwitcher and register and add it on the page. In this example, it's registered and added on the Master Page Site.master;Â <br>3.Â Add the SwitcherResources folder. It contains the Content and Scripts folders, the client resourcesÂ for Theme Switcher User Control andÂ Themes.xml file which contains the list of Bootstrap Themes.<br>AfterÂ performing all actions above, youÂ will have an attractive Theme Switcher like in our demos.</p>


<h3>Description</h3>

<p>BootstrapThemeSwitcher User Control contains an attribute ThemeLinkID and requires the value of the link's element id which is responsible for representing the current theme.<br>ThemeLinkID&nbsp;is connected with BootstrapThemeSwitcher's ASPxHiddenField and this value is used for changing the theme on the client side.</p>
